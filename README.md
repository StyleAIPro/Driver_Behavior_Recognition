# Driver_Behavior_Recognition

This project mainly focuses on evaluating the performance of some driving dataset 
using several traditional machine learning models.

In addition, this project also experiments with restricting the number of features to be included for training,
because often times not all features within a dataset contribute to the overall performance.

The default models are:
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- K Nearest Neighbors
- Multi-Layer Perceptrons
- Logistic Regression
- Gradient Boosting
- Linear Support Vector Machine
- AdaBoost
- Naive Bayes

This project evaluates and ranks features within the dataset using https://github.com/WillKoehrsen/feature-selector

The dataset used is from this research paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.05223
